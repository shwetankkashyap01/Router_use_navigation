      Stark Industries, later also known as Stark International, Stark
      Innovations, Stark Enterprises and Stark Resilient, is a fictional
      multi-national conglomerate appearing in American comic books published by
      Marvel Comics. Created by Robert Bernstein, Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby, the
      company first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (April 1962).[1] Stark
      Industries is depicted as being owned and run by businessman and namesake
      Tony Stark, who is also known as Iron Man, and was founded by Tony's
      father, Howard Stark, from whom he inherited the company. In the Marvel
      Cinematic Universe, Stark Industries has a logo modeled after the defense
      contractor Lockheed Martin[2] and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange
      as SIA. During the press conference scene, Stark is seen entering a
      building that resembles the entrance to Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works
      facility. An airplane extremely similar to the Lockheed YF-22 stood as a
      statue in front of the Stark Industries facility, exactly like the
      prototypes on display at Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California.
